## Introduction
The seventh module covered **Functions** and how to use functions to get information from a database.
## Summary
In this module, some of the key topics I learned about are:
1.	Functions: aggregate functions, selecting with common functions, partitioned functions
2.	Using functions when reporting
3.	User Defined Functions
4.	Creating Advanced GitHub pages
## Questions 
>1.	Explain when you would use a SQL UDF.
>2.	Explain are the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.

## Response
### When to use a SQL UDF

### Differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions
View – presentable format of a database with end user value. Views are user-facing information.
Functions – repeatable set of code to perform action on a particular database. It doesn’t necessarily have to be user-facing for output.
Stored Procedure – repeatable set of statements that can be reused across databases. It doesn’t necessarily have to be user-facing, and it doesn’t necessarily have to have a context of a single database.
