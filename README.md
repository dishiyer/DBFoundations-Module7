# Assignment 07 â€“ Functions

## Introduction
The seventh module covered **Functions** and how to use functions to get information from a database.

## Summary
In this module, some of the key topics I learned about are:
1.	Functions: aggregate functions, selecting with common functions, partitioned functions
2.	Using functions when reporting
3.	User Defined Functions
4.	Creating Advanced GitHub pages

## Questions 
>1.	Explain when you would use a SQL UDF.
>2.	Explain are the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.

## Response

### When to use a SQL UDF

User Defined Functions (UDF) should be used when performing an action that requires inputting parameters and expecting an output result based on the calculation within the functions. I would use SQL UDFs when I am trying to perform the same calculation repeatedly within the same database.

### Differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions

**Scalar Functions:** Scalar functions are functions that can be used to return a single value. The return value supports most data types.

**Inline Functions:** Inline functions can be used to return tables like a single query. The return value is therefore a table that can be further used in data analysis.

**Multi-Statement Functions:** These types of functions build upon the inline functions. They can return multiple query results which can be then used for further data analysis.
